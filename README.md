# These folders provide details of the raw data analysis for Vereshchagina _et al._ manuscript _“Gene expression and co-expression networks of Baikal endemic and Holarctic amphipods under temperature stress”_
## Data overview:
- The folder **“Figures”** contains figures that show the expression levels of the transcripts studied under control and experimental conditions in the three species studied. It also contains images of co-expression networks of Baikal endemic and Holarctic amphipods.

- The folder **“RNA extraction protocols”** contains detailed data of RNA extraction steps and data of all samples.

- The folder **“Scripts_R”** contains scripts created in the R program environment for plotting graphs and co-expression networks.

- The folder **“Tables”** contains Supporting information (Correlation analysis values of the experimental control and treatments groups of several candidate genes involved in metabolism and stress response in tissue of _E. verrucosus_, _E. cyaneus_ and _G. lacustris_ based on the R-script) as well as “Table 1” where are listed genes and primer sequences used for real-time PCR.

- The folders **“qPCR_(_E. cyaneus, E. verrucosus, G. lacustris_)”_ amplification data and calculations** contain amplification protocols, calculations results of real-time qPCR, NormFinder software results (NormFinder – tool for identifying normalization genes).
